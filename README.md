# McWeather
A weather application project by Michael Breen-McKay

## Requirements
- API key from [OpenWeatherMap](https://openweathermap.org/)

Project is in Alpha but plan to add the following features:
- A text-based interface that allows users to input the location (e.g., city name or zip code) for which they want to get the weather forecast.
- Fetch the relevant weather data for the specified location.
- Parse the JSON response received from the API and extract the necessary information, such as temperature, weather description, humidity, wind speed, etc.
- Present the weather forecast to the user in a readable and user-friendly format.
- Handle potential errors, such as invalid user input, network issues, or problems with the API response.
- Provide weather icons or images to represent different weather conditions (e.g., sun, rain, clouds).
- Allow users to specify units (e.g., Celsius or Fahrenheit) for temperature.
- Implement error handling and feedback messages to guide users when there are issues with their inputs or API requests.
- Add a feature to save frequently accessed locations for quick weather updates.
- Add GUI with either Tkinter or PyQt or possibly as a Flask web app
- Weather icons from:
